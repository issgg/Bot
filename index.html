  "The Game of Love.mp3": `Tell me just what you want me to be
One kiss and boom, you're the only one for me
So please tell me why don't you come around no more
'Cause right now I'm crying outside the door of your candy store
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss, now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm tellin' you, my babe, it's all in the game of love
This, whatever you make it to be
Sunshine will set on this cold lonely sea
So please, baby, try and use me for what I'm good for
It ain't sayin' goodbye, that's knockin' down the door of your candy store
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss, now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm tellin' you, my babe, it's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love
You roll me, control me, console me, please hold me
You guide me, divide me into what
So please tell me why don't you come 'round no more
'Cause right now I'm dying outside the door of your lovin' store
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss, now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm tellin' you, my babe, it's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love
It's all in the game of love
Let's play the game of love
Roll me, control me, please hold me
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain (Make me feel good, yeah)
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
(Now here on my own, on my own)
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain`,
  "Giorgio by Moroder.mp3": `When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because, it was, the dream was so big
That I didn't see any chance because
I was living in a little town, was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
I thought: Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance
Because all I really wanted to do is music
And not only play music, but compose music
At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques
So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque
Sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about seven, eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about
Almost two years to survive in the beginning
I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s
The sounds of the '60s, of the '70s
And then have a sound of the future
And I said: Wait a second, I know the synthesizer
Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?
And I didn't have any idea what to do
But I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track
Which then was synced to the Moog Modular
I knew that could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much the impact would be
My name is Giovanni Giorgio
But everybody calls me Giorgio

Once you free your mind about a concept of
Harmony and of music being correct
You can do whatever you want
So, nobody told me what to do
And there was no preconception of what to do`,
  "Within.mp3": `There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
I am lost, I can't even remember my name
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
(Where are the locks to try the key?)
I am lost, I can't even remember my name
(And I wonder why)
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
I've been, for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am`,
  "Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas).mp3": `I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need, because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when your 'round
I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the Roche
But no one gives us any time anymore

He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said
I listened to your problems, now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall

One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore

I listened to your problems, now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a–

I don't understand, don't get upset, I'm not with you
We're swimming around, it's all I do when I'm with you

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door`,

  "Lose Yourself to Dance (feat. Pharrell Williams & Nile Rodgers).mp3": `I know you don't get a chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here, take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

  "Touch (feat. Paul Williams).mp3": `Touch, touch
I remember touch
Touch, touch
I remember touch
Where do I belong?
Touch, I need something more
I remember touch
I need something more in my mind

Touch, I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see
A tourist in a dream
A visitor, it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss, suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?
A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Home, hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Hold on, if love is the answer, you're

Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
Let it go all night ...`,
  "Get Lucky (feat. Pharrell Williams & Nile Rodgers).mp3": `Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
...
We're up all night to get lucky`,

Beyond life
You will find your song
...
The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen`,

Letting the sunlight into my eyes
...
These moments will shine`,
  "Doin' it Right (feat. Panda Bear).mp3": `Doing it right

...
If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right`,
